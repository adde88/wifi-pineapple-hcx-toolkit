# Probe Response Only BPF Filter
#
# Purpose: Captures only Probe Response frames. This is a very clean and
#          efficient way to discover hidden SSIDs, as it only captures the
#          AP's response when a client probes for the hidden network.
#
# Usage:
# hcxdumptool-launcher --bpf probe-responses-only
#
# Generated with:
# hcxdumptool --bpfc="type mgt and subtype probe-resp"
