# Targeted Assessment Profile
# Optimized for focused penetration testing on specific targets.
# Use with: --profile targeted-assessment

# --- Core Settings ---

# Use a status-sorted real-time display to see handshakes/PMKIDs on top.
RDS_MODE=1

# We want to see all script output.
QUIET=0

# Fast channel hopping for quick assessment.
STAY_TIME=2

# Enable GPS for location correlation.
ENABLE_GPS=0

# --- Targeting Settings ---
# Use hcxdumptool's raw options to focus on AP attacks for PMKID collection.
HCXD_OPTS="--disable_client_attacks"

# IMPORTANT: Target filtering is now done with a BPF file.
# You must create this file and list your target AP MAC addresses in it.
BPF_FILE="/etc/hcxtools/bpf-filters/target-aps.bpf"

# --- NOTES ---
#
# 1. This profile requires you to create the BPF file specified above.
#    To target two APs with MACs 11:22:33:44:55:66 and AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF,
#    you can generate the BPF file with this command:
#
#    hcxdumptool --bpfc="wlan addr2 112233445566 or wlan addr2 aabbccddeeff" > /etc/hcxtools/bpf-filters/target-aps.bpf
#
# 2. For maximum information, run the launcher with the -v (verbose) flag:
#    hcxdumptool-launcher -v --profile targeted-assessment
