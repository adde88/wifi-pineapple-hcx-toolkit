# Evil Twin Reconnaissance Profile
# Passively gathers intelligence on a single target AP to prepare for cloning.
# Use with: --profile evil-twin-recon -channels 6 (or your target's channel)

# --- USER PRE-ACTIONS REQUIRED ---
# 1. Find the target AP's channel and update the CHANNELS variable below.
# 2. Find the target AP's MAC address (BSSID).
# 3. Create the BPF file with this command, replacing the MAC address:
#    hcxdumptool --bpfc="wlan addr2 112233445566" > /etc/hcxtools/bpf-filters/target-ap.bpf
# ----------------------------

# We want to see all output from the tool.
QUIET=0
RDS_MODE=1

# Run in a strictly passive mode, no deauthentication or attacks.
PASSIVE_MODE=1

# Use a BPF file to filter for a single BSSID.
