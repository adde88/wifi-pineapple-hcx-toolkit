# Wardriving Profile - For mobile data collection.
# Use with: --profile wardriving

# Attack mode should be passive to avoid disruption and gather data broadly.
# 'client' mode is good for this as it focuses on what devices are probing for.
ATTACK_MODE="client"

# Disable power saving to ensure the WiFi card is always scanning.
POWER_SAVE_DISABLE=1

# Run in quiet mode to avoid needing to interact with the script.
QUIET=1

# Disable the real-time display to save CPU cycles and battery.
RDS_MODE=0

# Enable GPS logging. This assumes a GPS dongle is connected and recognized.
# The main script will automatically enable hcxdumptool's GPS feature.
# You still need to pass the -g flag or set ENABLE_GPS=1 if you add it to the script logic.
# For now, this is a reminder; the -g flag is the primary enabler.

# Rotate capture files to prevent them from becoming too large.
# This example rotates every 100MB. The script uses --rotate-size for this.
# You would typically set this on the command line.
# For example: hcxdumptool-launcher --profile wardriving -g --rotate-size 100
