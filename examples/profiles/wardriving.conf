# Wardriving Profile - For mobile data collection.
# Optimized for use with the --wardriving-loop flag.
#
# Example Usage:
# hcxdumptool-launcher --profile wardriving --wardriving-loop 600   - (10 minutes)

# Set PASSIVE_MODE=1 to listen silently without transmitting any attack packets.
# This is ideal for broad, non-disruptive data gathering.
PASSIVE_MODE=0

# Run in quiet mode to avoid needing to interact with the script.
QUIET=1

# Disable the real-time display to save CPU cycles and battery.
RDS_MODE=0

# Enable GPS logging. This assumes a GPS device is connected and working with gpsd.
# The launcher will automatically add the required --gpsd and --nmea_pcapng flags.
ENABLE_GPS=0

# Note: The capture rotation is handled by the --wardriving-loop <seconds>
# command-line flag, which starts a new capture file for each interval.
