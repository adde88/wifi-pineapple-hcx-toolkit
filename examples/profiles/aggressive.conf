# Aggressive Profile - For active penetration testing.
# Use with: --profile aggressive

# Note: "all" attacks is the default behavior, so no specific attack
# flag is needed. This profile focuses on fast channel hopping and a
# status-oriented display.

# Use a status-sorted real-time display to see handshakes/PMKIDs on top.
RDS_MODE=1

# Use a shorter channel stay time to move through targets faster.
STAY_TIME=2

# You can add any other raw hcxdumptool options here if needed.
# For example, to make deauths more aggressive (use with caution):
# HCXD_OPTS="--m2max=10"
