# Use with: --profile aggressive

# Note: This profile relies on the default active attack behavior of hcxdumptool.
# It does NOT set passive mode.

# Use a status-sorted real-time display to see handshakes/PMKIDs on top.
RDS_MODE=1

# Use a shorter channel stay time to move through targets faster.
STAY_TIME=2
